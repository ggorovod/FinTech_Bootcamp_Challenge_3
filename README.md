# **Crypto Arbitrage**
---
![crypto](CryptoSS.png)



This is an analysis of potential cryptocurrency exchange arbitrage opportunities. The code contained in the Jupyter notebook attached to this repository takes an in-depth look into trading data from two cryptocurrency exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. It compares the closing prices at particular points of time and calculates potential profit to be generated at the beginning, middle, and end of the whole period under review. Using visual data and quantitative calculations, we are able to determine if simultaneous trading on the two exchanges would bring easy profits.
